The requirements and goals of the app I developed was to allow a user to log in with a username and password. They would be able to register a new account as well. Once logged in there is a grid display of the different items in the inventory. 

The features that were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app were the buttons that I needed to add for logging in. The text fields for username and password and the grid display buttons from the item inventory. 

The process of coding my app was very difficult to me and I was not able to get it running in time to turn it in. I worked with online vidoes and outside tutor help to get more of the hang of it. 

I was not able to test my code to make sure it was functional because the app did not work. 

The challenge I needed to overcome in this process was the coding aspect. 

The specific component from my mobile app that I was particularly successful in was working with the UI layout.
